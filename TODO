#Â TODO

1. Treat all absolute urls (in html-tags like: a, img, iframe... with attributes like `src=<url>`, `href=<url>`) as relative to `11ty.config.input` dir.
2. Translate them to destination **relative** urls
3. Force template-renderer to treat absolute url as relative to `11ty.config.input` dir, also. (maybe set `11ty.config._includes` to `''`?)


## Requirements:

- support *http server* mode
- support *file system* mode
- support custom styles
- support `content` folder setup
  - `content` folder is user data only
  - `content` folder is in separate repo and should be handled by `meri-doc-system`
  - all media in `media` subfolder
  - all pages in `pages` subfolder
  - support converting the directory structure of `pages`  subfolder to pages navigation(left aside)
